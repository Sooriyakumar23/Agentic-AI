Rankings also fluctuate.\\n\\n2. **Data availability is inconsistent:** Reliable, consistent industrial growth data isn\\'t available for all countries, especially the poorest.  Many lack robust statistical systems.\\n\\n3. **\"Industrial growth\" is broad:**  This could refer to manufacturing output, the overall industrial sector (including mining, utilities), or even broader economic activity related to industry.  The meaning significantly impacts the answer.\\n\\n4. **Growth is uneven:**  Even within a single country, industrial growth can be highly concentrated in specific regions or sectors, masking overall trends.\\n\\n\\nInstead of a specific number, it\\'s more accurate to say that the industrial growth of the world\\'s poorest economies is generally **low and volatile**.  These countries often face significant challenges hindering industrial development, including:\\n\\n* **Lack of infrastructure:** Poor transportation, energy, and communication networks impede industrial activity.\\n* **Limited access to capital:**  Businesses struggle to secure loans and investments.\\n* **Political instability and conflict:**  These disrupt production and discourage investment.\\n* **Human capital limitations:**  Lack of skilled labor and education hinder productivity.\\n* **Dependence on primary commodities:** Many rely heavily on exporting raw materials, leaving them vulnerable to price fluctuations and offering limited value addition.\\n\\n\\nTo find information on the industrial growth of a *specific* country often considered among the poorest, you would need to specify the country and consult sources like the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), and national statistical agencies.
